# Changelog

All notable, operator-visible changes to k8sCenter are recorded here. This file
is intentionally GitOps-visible — Argo CD and Flux dashboards that surface a
repository's README also surface this changelog, so breaking changes and
upgrade notes reach operators without requiring a release-notes email.

Format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions are not pinned here — k8sCenter releases by Helm chart version. The
sections below group changes by phase / security-audit round so reviewers can
correlate findings back to the audit reports under `docs/security/`.

## Phase 2 — Multi-cluster RBAC & TLS hardening (2026-05 audit)

The Phase 2 security audit produced three review rounds (2026-05-13,
2026-05-17, 2026-05-22) plus a round-3 best-judgment pass on 2026-05-23.
Findings and the patches that closed them are linked from
`docs/security/2026-05-22-audit-report.md`.

### Breaking changes (operator action required)

- **`allow_insecure_tls` column on `clusters`** (round-1 F#5; round-3 F#2).
  cluster_router.buildRemoteConfig no longer silently sets
  `TLSClientConfig.Insecure = true` when no CA data is stored. Admins must
  explicitly opt in by registering the cluster with `allowInsecureTLS=true`
  (admin role required) or by providing a CA certificate.

  - Migration `000016_cluster_allow_insecure_tls.up.sql` adds the column.
  - Migration `000017_backfill_allow_insecure_tls.up.sql` (round-3 F#2)
    auto-flags every existing CA-less non-local cluster as
    `allow_insecure_tls=true` to preserve pre-upgrade connectivity. Review
    the flagged rows in the cluster list (red "⚠ Insecure TLS" badge) and
    either supply a CA or accept the flag explicitly. See
    `backend/internal/store/migrations/NOTES.txt` for the inspection query
    and full operator runbook.
  - Down migrations are RETAINED for golang-migrate convention but are
    NOT a safe standalone rollback path — see the binary-rollback
    constraint block in `000016.down.sql`. Rolling back to a pre-F#5
    binary reintroduces the silent TLS-skip vulnerability the change
    was designed to close.

- **Slug-endpoint admin gate** (round-1 F#11). Endpoints that take a
  cluster slug (rather than the cluster's UUID) now require admin role
  even when the slug resolves to the local cluster. Non-admin tooling
  that hardcoded slug paths must switch to the UUID form.

- **Grafana proxy method narrowing** (round-1 F#14). The
  `/api/v1/monitoring/grafana/proxy/*` route now accepts only `GET` and
  `HEAD`. Dashboards or external integrations that previously POST'd to
  the proxy must switch to a server-side Grafana API call.

- **`MobileAuthConfig` JSON tag rename** (mobile M5 PR-5j, #282).
  `clientID → clientId` on the `/v1/auth/oidc/{providerID}/mobile-config`
  endpoint response. Public-store mobile builds must consume the new key
  before the wire format ossifies. Backend Go field name `ClientID`
  retained per Go style. This change is not strictly a security audit
  output but is shipping in the same window.

### Non-breaking (visibility, observability, defense-in-depth)

- **WebSocket confused-deputy gates** (round-1 P2-5, round-3 F#1).
  `handle_ws_logs`, `handle_ws_flows`, `handle_ws_logs_search` reject
  non-local `X-Cluster-ID` headers BEFORE the RBAC check or the
  upstream stream open. Audit `ResultFailure` recorded on rejection.

- **Singleflight ctx-cancel hardening** (round-2 F#17, round-3 F#3/F#6/F#15).
  cluster_router.remoteConfig and certmanager.fetchAllRemote use
  `context.WithoutCancel` so one HTTP caller's disconnect cannot poison
  every other coalesced waiter. 30s default cap when the caller did
  not set a deadline.

- **Cert-manager EvictRemoteCache hook** (round-3 F#8). Cluster deletion
  or credential update wipes the per-cluster cert cache in the same
  operation, preventing a brief leak of the previous tenant's cert list
  through a re-registered cluster ID.

- **Connection-test routes through ApplyClusterTLS** (round-3 F#13). The
  cluster-registration test exercises the same fail-closed TLS policy
  as the runtime router and probe; no policy drift between the two
  paths can silently slip through register-time.

- **OIDC refresh lifetime cap at 1h** (mobile M5 PR-5b). Propagates IdP
  revocation (account disabled, group removed) within an hour rather
  than waiting for the standard 7-day rotation cycle.

- **Audit logging on every WS rejection path** (round-2 F#7). The audit
  table — what compliance reviews actually read — now records both
  successful subscribes and rejected attempts. Previously the only
  forensic record of a rejected remote-cluster WS attempt was a slog
  warning.

## Pre-Phase-2 history

Pre-Phase-2 changes were tracked only in commit history and per-phase plan
docs (`plans/`). Starting from this audit cycle, every breaking change or
security-impactful patch lands in this file as well.
